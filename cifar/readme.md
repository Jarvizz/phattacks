## Notice 

Here, we found it is quicker and better to fine tune a trained model (use original images) with ROA. It converges super fast and therefore is not time consuming.

### All models have roughly same or better performance on clean dataset compared to original model.

For example, roa3by3fine30: the model fine tune original model with 3 by 3 (ROA) adversarial patch for 30 epochs.
roa3by3fine: the model fine tune original model with 3 by 3 (ROA) adversarial patch for 90 epochs.
